I'm a data analyst, quantitative researcher, and back-end programmer at [Kayma Labs](https://kayma.com/kayma-english.html). I have trained as an experimental researcher in the United States and Israel, and my work combines statistics, programming, and behavioral theory. I work in R, Python, SQL, & JavaScript.

I live in Israel with my wife and daughters. Outside of work I enjoy cookingüç≤ and gardeningüå±.
